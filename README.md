### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex box
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
I learned a few css tricks like translate, transform and visibility as well as javascript for each function. I learned how to manipulate the DOM.

### Continued development

Honestly this solution is not that good, I just patched up what I think would work but its not good. Will update this soon once I get better but I'm proud I was able to pull it off by myself.
